## What is Fabric?

Fabric is a Desktop Widgets System that you can customize using Python. It offers a variety of features to make the often tedious process of creating widgets much easier and more enjoyable!

Our goal is to provide a high-level, signal-based workflow‚Äîno polling or bash scripting required for even the most **basic** tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Fabric is still a work in progress. this means is that the API is a subject to change.
