# What is this?
Fabric is a python widgets _~~thing~~ framework_   made for \*Nix based systems (Wayland and X11), using GTK+

Fabric aims to provide you high-level and signal-based flow, neither polling nor bash scripting is required to do **basic** stuff, old men!

Also Fabric is configured in python which make's it easier than ever!

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that Fabric is still a work in progress, also the API is a subject to change.

### key features
1. **Simple** yet **Powerful**

	asking how simple actually it is?

	 \- head over to examples
1. X11 and Wayland ready!
2. All python modules are accessible to you!
3. Code  auto-completions ready!, see the stubs guide for more info: TBD
5. Less resource usage

	since everything can be written within the widget code this will no longer require you using external scripts, this will decrease the widget resource usage
