## What's Fabric?

Fabric is a Desktop Widgets System that you can customize using Python. It offers a variety of features to make the often tedious process of creating widgets much easier and more enjoyable!

Our goal is to provide a high-level, signal-based workflow‚Äîno polling or bash scripting required for even the **most basic** tasks.

## Key Features

1. **Simple** yet **Powerful**
2. Supports both **X11 and Wayland**
3. Access to **all other Python modules**
4. Excellent **Developer Experience (DevEX)** and typing support
5. **Low resource usage**
   - Built-in Python code replaces the need for resource-heavy shell scripts
